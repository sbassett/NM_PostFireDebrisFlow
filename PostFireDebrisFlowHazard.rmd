## Task Outline

- [ ] Develop a training set of areas burned during high-intensity burn periods
- [ ] Filter/clip burned areas to remove areas burned under "good fire" weather
- [ ] Develop explanatory variables to throw at the mode (or develop hypotheses and test them?)
- [ ] Predict DNBR

## Burn severity data to train the model

Post-fire debris flow hazard models use differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) measured from remotely sensed imagery to characterize burn severity.

As a fire burns across a landscape through time, fuel densities vary with space, and weather varies with time. Most of the area burned by wildfire is burned during high-intensity weather conditions that occur relatively rarely. The maps of burn severity that are used to parameterize burn severity models following a fire includes areas burned under all conditions, even mild conditions where the fire may have beneficial impacts on resource value. Predicting near worst-case burn severity from observed burn severity, without controlling for weather conditions during which the pixel burned will not help predict future high-severity burns. Are there areas that burned during relatively high-intensity fire weather conditions that dud not burn at high-severities? [Orientation?] of fire will also plausibly have an impact on burn severity, where areas that are hit by the brunt of the wind-driven active flaming front will be burned at higher severities than areas burned by a backing fire.

Burn progression maps could be used to calculate the rate of growth (e.g. area/hour) for each perimeter, and then we could isolate the areas with growth rates over a certain threshold for training the model. Alternatively we could combine burn perimeters with meteorological data (or fire risk indicators) to identify the areas primarily burned during days with relatively high-ERCs. Gridmet data from http://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html has ERC data available from 2013 onward.

## Wildfires in CO and NM

Based on query of the RAVG database (https://fsapps.nwcg.gov/ravg/data-access), there were 14 fires over 8,000 hectares (~19,768 acres) that burned in CO and NM between 2013 and 2020. This list has a few fires from 2020, but is missing a few like the Cameron Peak and Pine Gulch fires. When will these data become available? Do I need to run my own dNBR calculation? It looks like RAVG isn;t produced until 45 days after a fire is deemed "contained", given the end of the year, I wonder if these fires will be published soon (the 45 days is up, but the fires were "controlled" in January 2021.)

### West Fork Complex Trial [currently pseudo code]
Download West Fork RAVG data https://fsapps.nwcg.gov/mtbs/ravg_mysql/getZipFile.php?id=10407 [use https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.6.2/topics/download.file or RCurl (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html)?]
Unzip file [use: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.6.2/topics/unzip]
Render a map of the dNBR or burn severity classes (Ravg only has CBI not classified dNBR/soil burn severity).

```
ravg_url_WestFork2013 <- "https://fsapps.nwcg.gov/mtbs/ravg_mysql/getZipFile.php?id=10407"



```
Classify the RAVG dNBR raster into burn severity classes a la MTBS/BAER

Download all perimeter data for this fire from NIFC FTP. Can the "GIS" dat abe relied on or is should original IRN output be aggregated manually?

```
pregression_url_WestFork2013 <- ""

```


Intersect overlapping polygons, calculate period growth (hectares), period duration (hours? minutes?), and period average growth rate (hectares per hour? minute?)





## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
